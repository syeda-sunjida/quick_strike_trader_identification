Quick Strike Trader Detection

Overview

This repository contains Python scripts designed to identify and analyze traders who execute trades within a short duration (under 30 seconds). The scripts connect to a MySQL database, extract trade data, filter traders based on quick execution times, and generate reports for further analysis.

Files

1. To terminate under 30 seconds.py

Extracts trade data from a MySQL database for a specified time range.

Identifies traders who close their trades within 30 seconds of opening.

Fetches account and customer details related to these traders.

Generates a summarized report in an Excel file.

Outputs a file: filtered_trades_quick_close_summary_with_customer_info.xlsx containing detailed trade and account information.

2. Proof for hft 30.py

Loads the Excel report generated by To terminate under 30 seconds.py.

Filters trades under 30 seconds for specific trader logins.

Rearranges and formats the trade details.

Saves the results in a new Excel file: filtered_trades_under_30s_for_specific_logins_rearranged.xlsx.
